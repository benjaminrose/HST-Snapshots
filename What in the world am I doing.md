# Add local environment variables into SN Ia descriptor (like other MSCL & SALT2 variables) to minimize Hubble residuals

## Define local variables

### Fractional Pixel Rank

* SN locations
    - location in SDSS RA & Dec -> from SDSS photometry `.dat` files
    - shift between SDSS RA & Dec to HST RA & Dec -> leg work saved in a `.csv` file
    - location in HST RA & Dec -> math
    - Pixel value of the HST image -> 
* What pixels are galaxy
    * Define galaxy shape 
        - `sep` will get x, y, a, b & theta.
            + Need to work on what is our threshold (sigma, mag/sq arcsec, etc.)
            + threshold should be "good signal" and around to about 26 mag/sq arcsec



Talked to peter at 5:30 on nov 30:
I will use sdss to define galaxy (it has the deepest surface brightness)
use this definition in HST

Poster: choose 5 good, images with good HST details (like SN12860). Then we can easily compare how SDSS shows a very smooth image but HST still shows structure (Look we gained information!). The poster will be telling why what we are doing is important/useful/new (rather then look at the important results we have).
