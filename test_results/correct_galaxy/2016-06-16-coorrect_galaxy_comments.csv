# outside,Correct host but SN is outside the defined host size,
# out of field,SN is not in the “field of view” of the test,
# star,there is a foreground star in the way,
# ?,SN looks near the edge. Hard to tell by eye,
# wrong host,The wrong host is selected. Correct host is visible,
# de-blending issue,SDSS took two galaxies and thought they were one,
# hst,hst has most of its issues with too small of galaxy definitions,
# sdss,SDSS has a few wrong hosts (or out of the field wrong) but NO outside. AKA SDSS is deep!,
