# outside,Correct host but SN is outside the defined host size,,,
# out of field,SN is not in the “field of view” of the test,,,
# star,there is a foreground star in the way,,,
# ?,SN looks near the edge. Hard to tell by eye,,,
# wrong host,The wrong host is selected. Correct host is visible,,,
# de-blending issue,SDSS took two galaxies and thought they were one,,,
# hst,hst has most of its issues with too small of galaxy definitions,,,
# sdss,SDSS has a few wrong hosts (or out of the field wrong) but NO outside. AKA SDSS is deep!,,,
